* org-kanban

The start of what might eventually be a useful personal kanban mode for org. *Warning:
not even alpha software!*

** About

This package contains a single useful function, `org-kanban`, that lets you open
several editing windows into the same org-mode file, so that it can be
visualized as a kanban board.

The function is currently hard coded to look for the first top level heading,
and treat all direct children of that heading as the "states" of your kanban
board.

`org-refile-targets` is overridden in this buffer, so that refile actions are
focused on moving items between the different states.

** Help

This is obviously an incredibly limited tool at the present, and I'm really just
releasing it so prematurely in order to solicit feedback and help from the
community. It works for my purposes, but to make it work for *your* purposes,
I'm hoping you'll help by collaborating on some of the polish that makes it
useful outside my own .emacs file :)

*** TODO package as a proper emacs package
*** TODO write tests
*** TODO allow customization (via match syntax?) of kanban state sources
*** TODO log timestamps when refiling
*** TODO allow setting WIP constraints for each state
*** TODO calculate velocity
*** TODO support multi-person kanban boards

* org-kanban

The start of what might eventually be a useful personal kanban mode for org. *Warning:
not even alpha software!*

** About

This package contains a single useful function, `org-kanban`, that lets you open
several editing windows into the same org-mode file, so that it can be
visualized as a kanban board.

The function is currently hard coded to look for the first top level heading,
and treat all direct children of that heading as the "states" of your kanban
board.

`org-refile-targets` is overridden in this buffer, so that refile actions are
focused on moving items between the different states.

** Help

This is obviously an incredibly limited tool at the present, and I'm really just
releasing it so prematurely in order to solicit feedback and help from the
community. It works for my purposes, but to make it work for *your* purposes,
I'm hoping you'll help by collaborating on some of the polish that makes it
useful outside my own .emacs file :)

***** TODO package as a proper emacs package
***** TODO write tests
***** TODO allow customization (via match syntax?) of kanban state sources
      Should we also allow the user to designate which items represent specific
      states with potentially special meaning, such as "done"?
***** TODO log timestamps when refiling
      Log as properties to allow sorting lists based on how long the item has been sitting in that queue.
***** TODO log refile count to track "churn"
      Items that bounce around a lot are good candidates for review.
***** TODO allow setting WIP constraints for each state
      "Capacity" could be a property set on the headings used for each state.

      We can bounce attempts to refile into an over-capacity state easily enough.

      Stopping user from manually creating items in an over-capacity state could be more difficult.
***** TODO calculate velocity
      Given an org file with the right properties and history, we can calculate
      statistics for the user. These could include many interesting queueing measurements, such as:

      - average wait time via Little's Law
      - capacity utilization
***** TODO backlog focus mode
      Special mode that helps users triage large backlogs. This could
      incorporate multiple views of the same "state" subtree, each sorted /
      grouped in a different way.

      For instance, one might wish to see:

      - all items sorted by last refile time.
      - all items sorted by priority.
      - items grouped by the week/month that they were refiled.
      - items grouped by some arbitrary tag, then sorted by priority and refile time.
      - some kind of "smart" weighted list that considers priority, refile time, churn, tags, etc?
***** TODO support multi-person kanban boards
